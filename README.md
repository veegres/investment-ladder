# investment-ladder

An investment ladder is a strategy where you divide your investment portfolio into different maturity dates.
For example, with bonds, you might have bonds maturing at different times (1 year, 2 years, 5 years, etc.). 
This strategy helps spread out risk and provides liquidity as investments mature at different intervals.
It's like climbing a ladder, with each rung representing a different investment maturing at various times.
